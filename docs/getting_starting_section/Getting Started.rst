Overview of AI/ML Environments at TACC 
======================================

Selecting the right environment management tool is crucial for AI/ML projects which are typically built on top of a complex network of frequently updating software dependencies. There are several software tools that you can use to accomplish this including conda, virtual environments, and containers.   

In the first section of this tutorial we will cover:

#. How to connect to the computing resources at TACC
#. A high level overview of each environment management tool  
#. How to install pytorch and its dependencies using virtual environments, conda, and containers
