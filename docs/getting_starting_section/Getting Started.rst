Welcome to AI/ML Environments @ TACC 
====================================

Proper environment management is crucial in complex projects involving multiple languages, 
libraries, and frameworks. This is especially critical in complex AI/ML projects, where multiple libraries,
frameworks, and languages may be used.
Thankfully, various tools have been created to address this, including Conda, 
Virtual Environments, Containers, and Pip.   

In the first section of this tutorial we will cover:

#. Describe an overview of how to access and leverage TACCs supercomputers
#. Define and highlight the difference between various tools relevant to building AI/ML environments at TACC  
#. Gain experience installing Pytorch on our systems in three ways using virtual environments, conda and containers

If you are already familiar with this information, feel free to skip ahead to our advanced sections on Containers and Conda  
to learn how to best use the tools for AI/ML workloads at TACC.
